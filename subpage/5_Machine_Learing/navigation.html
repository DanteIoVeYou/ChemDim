    <p>To make a long story short, yeah, I have to decorate the subpage a bit plain.</p>
    <p>Here is where I share my Machine Learning Study Way and something I haven't think about clearly now.</p>
    <p>I start with the coursera lesson Machine Learning by Andrew Ng since 2021.10.24. </p>
    <p>Notes and my sincere feelings will be exhibited here, oops.</p>
    <p>10 24 equals 2^10 and hope it is a nice start in the 2th fall term.</p>
